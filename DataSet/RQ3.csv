#RussianUkrainianWar,7212700627690982662,2023-3-20,@metrouk,Kazakhstan,"Warmonger Vladimir Putin had a dose of reality while meeting people during a visit to a bombed out city of Ukraine.

Just days after an international arrest warrant was issued, he made a surprise visit to Mariupol, which has been occupied by the invaders since May 2022.

TV footage shows him out and about meeting supposedly grateful Ukrainians, but the focus has turned on a woman who was heard shouting: ‘It’s all lies, it’s all just for show.’

The heckling, which seemed to have come from a nearby building, prompted Mr Putin’s security team to begin frantically looking around trying to find the source of the disturbance.",51100,498,438,,1.

💥 «Наше основне завдання – штурмові дії. А найголовніше під час цих дій – зв’язок. Крім професійної підготовки бійців, звісно ж. Не буде зв’язку – не буде злагодженості, підтримки з неба і артилерії, – розповідає головний сержант аеромобільного підрозділу Дмитро «Дим». – А штурмові дії передбачають стрілецькі бої на коротких відстанях.
⚡️Нещодавно підрозділ Дмитра взяв у полон трьох окупантів біля Роботиного. Бійці штурмували посадку, закріпилися. А медик випередивши всіх, зненацька натрапив на ворожий бліндаж. Просто переплутав його з нашим, зайшовши туди як до себе додому. Там не розгубився й полонив російських зайд.

The US has banished Russia to the shadow realm. Today, they announced nearly 600 new sanctions on Russia for the murder of Navalny and for the continued invasion of Ukraine. The US is also looking at taking 300 billion dollars of Russia’s frozen assets and giving it directly to Ukraine. This was accompanied by a lot of new arrests and indictments of Russian businessmen. The new sanctions target Russia’s finances, defense industry, procurement, and those who help them evade sanctions. They have also placed sanctions and visa restrictions on over 300 officials for the kidnapping of Ukrainian children. The White House says this is just the beginning of their response to Navalny’s murder. The EU also joined in today’s Sanctions-palooza. With them sanctioning over a hundred foreign companies, including Chinese companies, for exporting dual-use goods to Russia. They also sanctioned a long list of Russian officials and in response, Russia banned more European Union officials from visiting Russia. Over 19,000 sanctions have been applied to Russia since the war began. It’s estimated that Ukraine has only a few weeks left before it’s out of ammunition as the Russian assault picks up speed. Russia is assisted by Iran and North Korea who are reported to have given Russia hundreds of new missiles. As cities continue to fall in Ukraine and Russia massacres whoever's left - The entire free world is now looking directly at Speaker Mike Johnson wondering how much Putin is paying him to not allow a vote on aid to Ukraine.",78400,3147,176,,1.

The invasion has likely resulted in tens of thousands of deaths on both sides and caused Europe's largest refugee crisis since World War II, with an estimated 8 million people being displaced within the country by late May as well as 7.8 million Ukrainians fleeing the country as of 8 November 2022. Within five weeks of the invasion, Russia experienced its greatest emigration since the 1917 October Revolution. The invasion has also caused global food shortages. The invasion has received widespread international condemnation. The United Nations General Assembly passed a resolution condemning the invasion and demanding a full withdrawal of Russian forces. Many countries imposed sanctions on Russia, as well as on its ally Belarus, which have affected the economies of Russia and the world, and provided humanitarian and military aid to Ukraine, totalling over $80B from 40 countries as of August 2022. Over 1,000 companies have pulled out of Russia and Belarus in response to the invasion. #ukraine #russia #ukraineinvasion #putin #zelensky",6738,498,76,,1. that was february?? didn’t feel like that long ago 2.

#UkraineWillWin,7321363062290697514,2024-1-7,@callsign_alaska,Ukraine,"The battle for Hostomel Airport was the first ground battle of the Russian invasion after its commencement in February 2002. Beginning early on 24 February, the battle itself only lasted around 36 hours. A Russian air assault was attempted against the airfield, with its mission being to seize the Hostomel airport, creating an airhead for the subsequent air-landing of a larger Russian force of infantry and light armour.
The location of the airfield, approximately 20 kilometres to the northwest of Kyiv, was key. Russia aimed to use the capture of the airfield as a springboard to ‘march on Kyiv’, hopefully overthrow the government, and as a minimum, pressure Ukraine into political accommodations.
A Ukrainian National Guard unit - the 4th Rapid Reaction Brigade - had around 200 troops based in close proximity to the airfield. With very short warning of the Russian air assault, the commander of the troops was able to deploy his soldiers to shoot down Russian helicopters and ensure that the Russians were unable to use their preferred landing zone for their air assault troops. Supported by Ukrainian artillery, the Ukrainian national guard troops imposed sufficient delay on the Russians to allow deployment of additional Ukrainian units to defend the airfield.
The Russian air land operation was cancelled, and the Russians instead conducted a ground advance south from Belarus to seize the airfield with several mechanised Battalion Tactical Groups. While the Ukrainians eventually withdrew from the airfield on 25 February, their actions on 24 February prevented the Russian coup de main on Kyiv. This set the operational conditions for the eventual defeat of the Russian invasion in northern Ukraine.

They are struggling to hold the line against Russia and are facing relentless pressure from all directions. The military is short on ammo, troops, and weapons. And there’s no sign of relief coming as Putin’s assets in the US House keep blocking aid, loans, and sales to Ukraine. Some troops are having to restrict their ammunition use and are often outgunned three to one. Ukraine’s artillery has more or less come to a stop because they can’t get shells for their US supplied Howitzers while its Patriot missile systems are also basically out of ammo. Due to the lack of US air defense missiles, Russia was able to bomb Avdiivka over 600 times last month. In comparison, the city was essentially a no-fly-zone in December. The only thing Ukraine has going for it right now is drones which cover the air so much that Russian soldiers say that the sky practically hums. Some say they have given up diving for cover. Putin says that a ceasefire in Ukraine was vetoed by the United States. But the US says that there are no back channel negotiations with Russia because they won’t engage in talks about Ukraine without Ukraine. Russian sources told Reuters that the Americans didn’t believe that Putin was serious and that they basically told them - if you want a ceasefire, go talk to Ukraine. This has angered Russia who now says they no longer see a point in talking to the US.",176600,9623,479,,"1. Man I get it but the US People are struggling. Why can’t we help ourselves?

However I believe that the the multi billions that was given to them could be used on the states that have high poverty rates, low education, etc 6. Why do they have to depend on the US? Let them go to NATO or the UN.

Since December 31, Russian inhumans have already used about 170 ""shahedis"" and dozens of rockets of various types. The absolute majority of them were aimed at civilian objects. I thank all partners who help in strengthening our air shield. And it's obvious that it helps save hundreds of lives every day and every night that would have been taken by Russian terror if it weren't for Patriots and other defense systems.

This year, we will continue working with everyone in the world who values ​​life to further strengthen our air shield and hold Russia accountable for what it has done. A terrorist state must feel the consequences of what it does.”
