Russia has released a video of them ___ a Ukrainian soldier. Russia continues to employ ___ tactics at every single level of this war from executing entire towns to beheading prisoners of war. Russia is currently the largest terror group on the planet and President Biden should join Senate Republicans in legally declaring them as such. Several countries have already recognized Russia’s war as genocide and the President declared it one last year.

#UkraineWillWin,7321363062290697514,2024-1-7,@callsign_alaska,Ukraine,"The battle for Hostomel Airport was the first ground battle of the Russian invasion after its commencement in February 2002. Beginning early on 24 February, the battle itself only lasted around 36 hours. A Russian air assault was attempted against the airfield, with its mission being to seize the Hostomel airport, creating an airhead for the subsequent air-landing of a larger Russian force of infantry and light armour.
The location of the airfield, approximately 20 kilometres to the northwest of Kyiv, was key. Russia aimed to use the capture of the airfield as a springboard to ‘march on Kyiv’, hopefully overthrow the government, and as a minimum, pressure Ukraine into political accommodations.
A Ukrainian National Guard unit - the 4th Rapid Reaction Brigade - had around 200 troops based in close proximity to the airfield. With very short warning of the Russian air assault, the commander of the troops was able to deploy his soldiers to shoot down Russian helicopters and ensure that the Russians were unable to use their preferred landing zone for their air assault troops. Supported by Ukrainian artillery, the Ukrainian national guard troops imposed sufficient delay on the Russians to allow deployment of additional Ukrainian units to defend the airfield.
The Russian air land operation was cancelled, and the Russians instead conducted a ground advance south from Belarus to seize the airfield with several mechanised Battalion Tactical Groups. While the Ukrainians eventually withdrew from the airfield on 25 February, their actions on 24 February prevented the Russian coup de main on Kyiv. This set the operational conditions for the eventual defeat of the Russian invasion in northern Ukraine.

They are struggling to hold the line against Russia and are facing relentless pressure from all directions. The military is short on ammo, troops, and weapons. And there’s no sign of relief coming as Putin’s assets in the US House keep blocking aid, loans, and sales to Ukraine. Some troops are having to restrict their ammunition use and are often outgunned three to one. Ukraine’s artillery has more or less come to a stop because they can’t get shells for their US supplied Howitzers while its Patriot missile systems are also basically out of ammo. Due to the lack of US air defense missiles, Russia was able to bomb Avdiivka over 600 times last month. In comparison, the city was essentially a no-fly-zone in December. The only thing Ukraine has going for it right now is drones which cover the air so much that Russian soldiers say that the sky practically hums. Some say they have given up diving for cover. Putin says that a ceasefire in Ukraine was vetoed by the United States. But the US says that there are no back channel negotiations with Russia because they won’t engage in talks about Ukraine without Ukraine. Russian sources told Reuters that the Americans didn’t believe that Putin was serious and that they basically told them - if you want a ceasefire, go talk to Ukraine. This has angered Russia who now says they no longer see a point in talking to the US.",Inclined towards Ukraine,176600,9623,479,,"1. Man I get it but the US People are struggling.
